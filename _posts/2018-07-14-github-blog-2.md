This is Tutorial 2: creating a github blog. **Those who do have same result with original style skip to Step 2 ** Those who have different result read from step 1 :)

5) GO down and click commit changes.
- Write what you committed or else automatically Update _config.yml will be written.
- Get used to writing what you committed, so that you won't forget what was changed.

<h2>Step 2: Use Markdown Editor to make a post</h2>

I will show how to upload posts using markdown editor. I recommend **Typora** for Windows users & **Haroopad** for Mac users. Since I use Mac I will use Haroopad.<br>

1) Go to Haroopad website.<br>
2) Click Users<br>

3) Scroll down and click icon that represents your OS

4) If you install you will see following screen.
- Click a blue button that is on bottom right.It will show how you can add hyperlinks, make fonts bigger, emphasize and etc.
- For example) Writing ******Bing****** will make the word bold like this - **Bing**
