<p>Today I will explain about how to create a github blog. If you follow my instructions well, you will be able to create your own github blog in **15 minutes**. I am also not an expert in this field, but I want to help people who are in complete beginner's stage than me. </p>

<h3>Prerequisite before starting this tutorial:</h3>
- Installation of git (go to start git post to install the git)


<h2>Step 1: Create a github account</h2>


1) Go to https://github.com/ and pick a username, email, and a password.
- Note that your **username** will be the **address** of your github blog. So, carefully think of your username. For example) My username is dojinkimm, then my blog address will be dojinkimm.github.io!!!

2) Sign In

<h2>Step 2: Find a blog style</h2>
- We are going to create a blog using a Jekyll. Just remember that we are using Jekyll but I am not going to explain it deeply(no need to know).

1) Go to  @[http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/)

2) Find a blog style that you like and click it (I am using hydejack so I will click it)

3) Check if it is MIT License and click **Homepage**

4) Click a **fork** button that is in top right corner, and wait a little.

<h2>Step 3: Create your github blog</h2>

1) Go to Settings

2) Change a name so that it will be [your_username.github.io] (no need brackets)

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/imgs/github/changename.png"/>


3) Wait a minute and type [your_username.github.io] in your browser.

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/imgs/github/gosite.png"/>
